<h2>Nutrition and Healthy Eating</h2>
<p>Healthful eating and regular exercise are two of the simplest, most effective ways that women and men can improve their health. 
A balanced, nutritious diet lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic conditions. 
Combining a balanced diet with a regular physical activity offers numerous benefits, including improving cardiovascular health, 
mood, quality of sleep and reducing stress.</p></main>
